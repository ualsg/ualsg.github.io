Sifan is a PhD candidate in the School of Architecture, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), and a Computational Social Science Lab (CSSL) Fellowship recipient in the Faculty of Social Science, CUHK.
Her research interests focus on urban analytics, and employing multi-source open data to quantitatively characterize urban form, design, and planning characteristics, and their impact on residentsâ€™ perceptions and health outcomes.
She is now working on evaluating the perceived restoration and stress of the street-built environment in high-density city contexts, mainly integrating urban big data, including social media content and street view images.
She holds a bachelor's degree in Landscape Architecture from Beijing Forestry University and a master's degree in Urban Design from CUHK.
