abstract: 'Recognising GeoAI as an emerging and rapidly evolving field that has been increasingly adopted in urban geography, this chapter provides an overarching overview of the GeoAI methods for urban analytics. It begins by revisiting the theoretical underpinnings of urban theory and mapping the evolution of urban spatial analytics, tracing the journey from traditional statistical methods to the cutting-edge AI-driven approaches reshaping the discipline today. Beyond examining the current state of GeoAI, the chapter also identifies current trending topics and investigates future directions for developing human-centric methodologies that prioritise the needs and experiences of urban residents. By emphasising the human dimension of urban analytics, the chapter seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on how GeoAI can be harnessed to enhance city governance, urban planning, and the overall quality of urban life.'
