abstract: 'Urban areas stand at the forefront of the climate crisis, facing escalating environmental pressures, growing social inequalities, and heightened risks to human health and well-being. These challenges are especially pronounced in rapidly expanding cities across the Global South, where informal settlements, resource constraints, and inadequate infrastructure amplify vulnerabilities. Conventional urban planning and management approaches, developed prior to recent advances in data-intensive urban analysis, are increasingly unable to address the complexity, scale, and dynamism of these issues.'
