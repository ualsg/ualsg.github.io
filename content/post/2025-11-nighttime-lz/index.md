Using a new approach, the study has mapped Singapore's night-time brightness, revealing contrasts among the city-state's regions. The study found that eastern residential areas, which are denser and more active, are brighter than the western zones, which are home to more industrial estates and nature reserves. We appreciate that our work has been put in the spotlight.
