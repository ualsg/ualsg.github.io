The PI of the NUS Urban Analytics Lab, {{% mention "filip" %}} was appointed in associate editor roles in two leading journals -- [Computers, Environment and Urban Systems (CEUS)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-environment-and-urban-systems) and [Landscape and Urban Planning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/landscape-and-urban-planning), both top 1% journals in their categories.

This set of appointments is also a recognition of our research group, which we highly appreciate.

These two journals have been a great inspiration to our Lab thanks to their authors, reviewers, and editors.
Thank you.
This is a great opportunity to pay that forward.
